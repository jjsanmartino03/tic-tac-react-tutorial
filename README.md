# Tic-tac-toe React App
This is the page I did following the React tutorial from [here](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html). It's super simple, just the tic-tac-toe game with a "time-travel" option. The only thing I added to the tutorial was React-Bootstrap.

This project is hosted [here](https://react-tic-tac-toe-puzzle.herokuapp.com/).
